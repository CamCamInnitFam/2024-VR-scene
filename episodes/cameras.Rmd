## What is a camera in a 3D scene?

A camera in a 3D space is a perspective. It is a virtual viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.
This perspective defines what is visible and how it is seen.

The perspective is defined by the camera's:
    - Position
      - Where the camera is situated within the 3d scene
    - Orientation
      - The direction the camera is facing
    - Field of View
      - How wide the camera's view is, how much of the scene is visible from this perspective


## How to create cameras for VR and non-VR environments

A camera is created differently in each engine, but all are as simple as drag and dropping them into the environment

### Unity
```txt
In the editor you right left click on the hierarchy of the environment and then in the drop-down menu click camera which will create a new camera in the environment
```

### Unreal Engine
```txt
In the editor you click on window followed by place anchors then all classes and then to place a camera you drag the camera anchor into the environment where you want it
```

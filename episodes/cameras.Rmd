## What is a camera in a 3D scene?

A camera in a 3D space is a perspective. It is a virtual viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.
This perspective defines what is visible and how it is seen.

The perspective is defined by the camera's:
    - Position
      - Where the camera is situated within the 3d scene
    - Orientation
      - The direction the camera is facing
    - Field of View
      - How wide the camera's view is, how much of the scene is visible from this perspective
